Mechanism design has always been a great interest of mine, and I studied several problems when I was beginning out research. One problem I worked on was fair resource allocation, and I found an impossibility result: any efficient and strategy-proof allocation mechanism must be dictorial, when there are 2 agents. Several monthes later I would have found out that the problem was already studied by the economics community and the impossibility result was already known. Nevertheless, the proof I found is conceptually much simpler, and yields some new insights to the problem. 

Background
=============

In game theory, we study the strategic behaviors of (selfish) agents in decision-making systems. Perhaps a well-known example is the rock-paper-scissors game: what strategy should each agent adapt to maximize their chances of winning? Another example is the prisoner's dilemma. Two criminals are captured and interrogated, and each has the option to stay silent or betray his partner: if both stay silent, they spend 1 year in prison (since the law enforcement has no sufficient evidence); if both betrays, they spend 4 years in prison (the law enforcment would have sufficient evidence); if one betrays and the other stays silend, the one who stayed silent gets 6 years in prison, while the one who betrayed walks out clean. An unfamiliar reader may think about the best strategy for each criminal in the prisoner's dilemma. 

Mechanism design is a subfield of game theory, and it is sometimes called 'reverse game theory'. In game theory, there is a fixed rule as how payoff are generated for different possible actions of agents(when two players show their hand in rock-paper-scissors, it is clear who won). In mechanism design, we aim to design such rules, in order to elicit desirable behaviors from rational decision makers. 

Let's assume there is a set of resources that we wish to allocate among 2 agents. But the 2 agents have different private valuation for each item, and we ask the agents to report their valuation for each item. As an example, think of a CEO deciding how to allocate resources between two branches. A natural idea would be to give each item to the agent that values it the most, but we immediately see the problem with this: agents will just report arbitrarily high valuations, in order to secure the resources to themselves. This brings to a very desirable and important property that we wish to elicit from agents: truthfulness. Namely, can we design an allocation rule, such that the payoff enjoyed by each agent can be maximized when they are reporting truthfully their valuations? The answer is yes, and we can quite easily design such a allocation rule: assuming items are divisible, give half of everything to the 1st agent, and half of everything to the 2nd agent, regardless of the reported valuations. However, such a rule may not be 'optimal': suppose agent A values the 1st item more and agent B values the 2nd item more, then by giving agent A the 1st item and B the 2nd item increases both agent's payoff. We call such sub-optimal allocations inefficient. A natural question to ask is: does there exists an allocation rule, such that it is both strategyproof and efficient? 


The formal problem
=============
In this section I will formally define the problem. 




Strategyproofness brings forth many impossibility results in economics and game theory. Some of the earliest impossibility results in exchange economies are that of Hurwitz and Zhou: in short, strategyproofness together with efficiency implies a dictatorship. Schummer studied strategyproofness on the restricted domain of linear preferences, and showed the impossibility result still holds. I revisit the two agent linear exchange economy and give an alternative proof of Schummer's result.
