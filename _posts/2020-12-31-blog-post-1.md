In this post, I'll give an alternative proof of a classic impossibility result in exchange economies. Namely, in a two-agent linear exchange economy, any strategyproof, efficient allocation mechanism must be dictatorial. The proof is elementary and easily accessible, and provides some new insights for the problem.

Background
=============
Strategyproofness brings forth many impossibility results in economics and game theory. Some of the earliest impossibility results in exchange economies are that of Hurwitz and Zhou: in short, strategyproofness together with efficiency implies a dictatorship. Schummer studied strategyproofness on the restricted domain of linear preferences, and showed the impossibility result still holds. I revisit the two agent linear exchange economy and give an alternative proof of Schummer's result.
